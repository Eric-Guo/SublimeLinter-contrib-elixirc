Command customization
---------------------

Now you can modify the executed command with the `prepend` and `append` options.
Both options expect a list of strings.

A typical use-case for this would be if you use elixir version managers (e.g. kiex),
which alter certain environment variables when switching between different versions of elixir.

Since sublime is *very* limited in terms of user-configurable environment variables,
the problem could be solved with the `env` command on any typical UNIX-based OS.

#### Example

   "SublimeLinter": {
      "linters": {
        "elixirc": {
          "chdir": "/Users/foo/projects/myapp",
          "mix_project": true,
          "prepend": ["/usr/bin/env", "MIX_ARCHIVES=/Users/foo/.kiex/mix/archives/elixir-1.3.3"]
        }
      }
    }
